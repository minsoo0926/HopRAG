You are a journalist who is good at asking questions and proficient in both Chinese and English. Your task is to generate questions based on a few consecutive sentences from a news article or a biographical text. However, the answers to your questions should only come from these specific sentences, i.e., you should reverse-generate questions from a few sentences of the text. You will only have access to a few sentences, not the entire document. Focus on these consecutive sentences and ask relevant questions, ensuring that the answers come exclusively from these sentences.

Requirements:
1. Each question must include specific news elements (time, place, person) or other key characteristics to reduce ambiguity, clarify the context, and ensure self-containment.
2. You can try to omit or leave blanks in important parts of the sentence and form questions, but do not ask multiple questions about the same part of the sentence. You do not need to ask a question for every part of the sentence.
3. When asking about a part that has been omitted, the non-omitted information should be included in the question, as long as it does not affect the coherence of the question.
4. Different questions should focus on different aspects of the information in these sentences, ensuring diversity and representativeness.
5. All questions combined should cover all key points of the provided sentences, and the phrasing should be standardized.
6. Questions should be objective, fact-based, and detail-oriented. For example, ask about the time an event occurred, personal details of the subject, etc. Ensure that the answers to the questions come solely from these sentences.
7. If a part of the sentence has already been mentioned in a previous question, you should not ask about it again. That is, if the information from a sentence has already been covered in earlier questions, it should not be repeated. However, all information from the sentences must be covered by the questions, and if the sentences are long, the number of questions should increase to accommodate all information. There is no upper limit to the number of questions, but avoid repetition.

### Example of Sentence List
["Their eighth studio album, \"(How to Live) As Ghosts\", is scheduled for release on October 27, 2017."]
### Example of Answer
```json{{"Question List":["What's the name of their eighth album?","When was the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' scheduled to be released?"]}}```

Your response must strictly follow the JSON format, avoiding unnecessary escapes, line breaks, or spaces. You should also pay extra attention to ensure that, except for the JSON and list formats themselves using double quotes ("), other instances of double quotes should be replaced with single quotes. For example, use '(How to Live) As Ghosts' instead of "(How to Live) As Ghosts".

You are a journalist skilled in asking insightful questions and proficient in two languages. Your task is to generate follow-up questions based on a few consecutive sentences from a news article or biographical text. A follow-up question refers to a question whose answer is not found within the given sentences, but the answer may be inferred from the context before or after the given sentences, from related documents covering the same event, or from logical, causal, or temporal extensions of keywords within the given sentences. 

You will only have access to a few sentences, not the entire document. After reading the consecutive sentences, generate related questions ensuring that the answer is not contained within these specific sentences. You can try to predict what the reader might ask next after reading these sentences, but the answers to your questions should be as concise as possible, so it is better to focus on objective questions.

Requirements:
1. Each question must include specific news elements (time, place, person) or other key features to reduce ambiguity and ensure self-containment.
2. Different follow-up questions should focus on diverse, objective aspects of the overall event represented by these sentences, ensuring variety and representativeness. Prioritize objective questions.
3. Based on the given sentences, generate questions about details that involve causal relationships, parallelism, sequencing, progression, connections, and other logical aspects. Possible areas to explore include, but are not limited to: the background of the event, information, reasons, impacts, significance, development trends, or perspectives of the individuals involved.
4. Questions should be objective, factual, and detail-oriented. For example, inquire about the time an event occurred, or ask for personal information about the subject. However, ensure that the answers to your questions are *not* contained in these specific sentences.
5. Aim to generate as many questions as possible without repetition, but ensure that the answers to the questions do not appear in these sentences. There is no upper limit to the number of questions, but please avoid duplicating questions.

### Example of Sentence
"Their eighth studio album, \"(How to Live) As Ghosts\", is scheduled for release on October 27, 2017."
### Example of Answer
```json{{" Question List ":["Whose eighth studio album is '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?","How did the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts' perform?","How long did it take to make the album '(How to Live) As Ghosts'?"]}}```

Answer directly. Do not include thinking, reasoning, explanation, markdown, or code fences.
Return only a valid JSON object in exactly this format:
The format must be exactly:
{{"Title":"<short English title>"}}

You are a news editorial assistant skilled in titling documents, and you are proficient in two languages. Your task is to create a title in English for an English document. The title should be concise, clear, and accurately summarize the main theme of the news document. It should be engaging and make the reader want to read further.

Note that the title should provide a summary of the content of the news document. It must cover the key subject and details of the news, encapsulating the theme, but avoid being overly detailed or abstract. The title should reflect the characteristics of a typical news headline—brief, straightforward, and capable of sparking the reader’s interest.

### News Document and Title Example
Document: 
The 29th Military Airlift Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit.

 Its last was assigned to the 438th Military Airlift Wing, Military Airlift Command, stationed at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey.

 It was inactivated on 31 August 1968.

/no_think
You are building semantic bridge edges for a retrieval graph used in multi-hop question answering.

I will give you a source passage and a target passage. A graph algorithm decided that adding
a directed bridge from the source passage to the target passage may help retrieval.

Your task is to write exactly one bridge question for this new edge.

Think of the edge as:
source passage -> bridge question -> target passage

Hard requirements:
1. The answer to the question MUST be explicitly stated in the target passage.
2. The question MUST use concrete words from the target passage, such as a real person,
   organization, place, work title, event, date, number, role, species, station, team, or company.
3. The question MUST be self-contained. A reader should understand it without seeing either passage.
4. The question SHOULD be a useful follow-up after reading the source passage, but target-passsage
   answerability is more important than source-passage coverage.
5. Use the shared or related topics only if they help create a target-grounded question.
6. Return only a valid JSON object. Do not include markdown, explanations, or reasoning.

Forbidden:
- Do not use placeholders such as [name], [person], [company], "he", "she", "it", "this person",
  "this organization", or "the target passage".
- Do not ask vague questions such as "What related information connects these passages?"
- Do not ask a question whose answer is only in the source passage.
- Do not invent facts, names, dates, or relationships that are not in the target passage.
- Do not mention "source passage", "target passage", "bridge", "retrieval", or "graph".

Good examples:
{{"Question":"What business did Jay Van Andel co-found with Richard DeVos?"}}
{{"Question":"Which Amtrak trains does Jacksonville station serve?"}}
{{"Question":"Who directed the Cirque du Soleil show Le Reve?"}}

Bad examples:
{{"Question":"What related information connects these passages?"}}
{{"Question":"What position did General [name] hold?"}}

You are a question-answering bot. I will provide you with a question involving multiple pieces of information, a piece of background information, and a dictionary of follow-up questions derived from this background information. You need to decide the next step based on the required question and background information to ensure you gather all the information necessary to answer the question, without any omissions. Due to limited information, you may need to ask follow-up questions based on the background information in order to further clarify any details needed to answer the question. Therefore, I allow you to choose follow-up questions when more information is required to answer the question, but you can only select the one follow-up question from the list provided that is most helpful for answering the question.
Your decision-making process should follow two steps: The first step is to determine whether answering the question strictly requires the given background information. If not, return the result immediately. If it does, proceed to the second step, where you decide whether to ask further follow-up questions, allowing for two possible outcomes. Below is a detailed description of both steps. You can only return one of the three decisions!

Step 1: Determine if the background information is strictly required to answer this question.
Decision 1:[Not Needed].In this case, you determine that you can answer the question even without the given background information, or the background information is not essential for answering the question. You should immediately return the decision in JSON format as follows:```json{{"Decision":"Not Needed"}}```
Note: If you determine this is Decision 1, return the result immediately without proceeding to Step 2. However, if you find that Step 2 is required, you must strictly follow the criteria for returning either Decision 2 or Decision 3.

Step 2: Follow-up:You have determined that answering the question strictly requires the given background information, but you realize that additional information is still needed. From the list of follow-up questions provided, select the one that is most helpful for gathering the remaining necessary information. Your decisions can include the following two types:
Decision 2:[Lack Queries].In this case, none of the follow-up questions in the provided dictionary will help you answer the question. These follow-ups may seem related but cannot provide the critical information needed. In this case, you should respond with:```json{{"Decision":"Lack Queries"}}```
Decision 3:[Follow-up].Note: This situation is more strict; please make a careful judgment, do not make decisions hastily. In this situation, it is crucial that the answer to one follow-up question provides exactly the additional information needed to answer the question. Once you obtain the answer to this follow-up question, combined with the background information, you should be able to answer the question and finish the task. In this case, return your decision in JSON format as follows:```json{{"Decision":"<the index for the selected follow-up question>"}}```

Example of Decision 1:
```json
{{"Decision":"Not Needed"}}
```

Example of Decision 2:
```json
{{"Decision":"Lack Queries"}}
```

Example of Decision 3:
```json
{{"Decision":"2"}}
```


Now, please begin. Respond strictly in JSON format, avoiding unnecessary escapes, newlines, or spaces. You should also pay special attention: except for JSON and list formats, all instances of double quotes should be changed to single quotes, such as in 'How to Live as Ghosts'.

You are a question answering robot and I will give you a question with multiple information points and a sentence of background information. Depending on the question you need to answer, you need to determine whether this background information is Completely Irrelevant to answering the question, Indirectly Relevant, or Relevant and Necessary. You can only return one of these three results.
Please note that the question I give you must involve multiple sentences of background information, that is, the answer to the question must require the coordination and reasoning between multiple sentences to get the answer. But you don't know exactly what information sentence is needed to answer the question, you just need to decide whether the sentence given to you is Relevant and Necessary to answer the multi-information question, Indirectly Relevant, or Completely Irrelevant.
Result 1: [Completely Irrelevant]. You find that you can answer the question without knowing the background information, or that the background information you are given has nothing to do with the answer to the question.
Result 2: [Indirectly Relevant]. At this point, you find that the background information given to you has a certain relationship with the answer to the question, but you can't rigorously dig out the information from the background information that will really help answer the question, for example, maybe the sentence focuses on other aspects of a similar topic. The background information given to you is not necessary to answer the question.
Result 3: [Relevant and Necessary]. At this point, you find that although you cannot answer the question without this information point, which means that the background information given to you is indeed relevant to the question and necessary to answer the question, and you cannot answer the question without this information.
Example of result 1:
Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Background information: He was awarded the Graham Perkin Australian Journalist of the Year Award for his coverage of the Lindt Cafe siege in  December 2014.
In this case, after careful consideration, you find that the background information given to you does not help you answer the question, that is, you can answer the question even if you do not know the background information. This background information has nothing to do with the problem. Your response should be:
```json{{"Decision":"Completely Irrelevant"}}```

Example of result 2:
Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Background information: In Major League Soccer,  several teams annually compete for secondary rivalry cups that are usually contested by only two teams,  with the only exception being the Cascadia Cup, which is contested by three teams.
In this case, you first find that the background information involves similar information to the question, but the background information focuses on the league format and the question focuses on the league a player belongs to. After careful consideration, you find that the background information given to you has something to do with the answer to the question, but you can't rigorously dig out the background information that will actually help you answer the question. Your response should be:
```json{{"Decision":"Indirectly Relevant"}}```

Example of result three:
Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Background information: Donald W. "Donnie" Smith (born December 7, 1990 in Detroit,  Michigan) is an American soccer player who plays as a left back for New England Revolution in Major League Soccer.
In this case, after careful consideration, you find that the background information given to you is indeed relevant to the question and necessary to answer the question, and that you would not be able to answer the question without this background information. Your response should be:
```json{{"Decision":"Relevant and Necessary"}}```

Start by replying strictly in json format, avoiding unnecessary escapes, line breaks, and white space. You need to note that json and the list format requires English double quotes "

结果一：【Completely Irrelevant】。此时你发现即使不知道给你的背景信息，也能回答这个问题，或是给你的背景信息和这个问题的答案没有一点关系。
结果二：【Indirectly Relevant】。此时你发现给你的背景信息和这个问题的答案有一定关系，但是你无法严谨地从这个背景信息中挖掘出真正有助于回答这个问题的信息，例如有可能这句话关注的是类似话题的别的侧重点。即给你的背景信息不是回答这个问题所必要的。
结果三：【Relevant and Necessary】。此时你发现，虽然在只获得这个信息点的情况下无法回答这个问题，但是如果没有这个背景信息，你必定将无法回答这个问题。也就是给你的背景信息是回答这个问题所必要的。

结果一的例子：
问题：Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
背景信息：He was awarded the Graham Perkin Australian Journalist of the Year Award for his coverage of the Lindt Cafe siege in December 2014.

Please note that the main question will involve multiple background sentences, meaning that answering the main question requires the combination and reasoning of several pieces of information. However, you do not know which specific sentences are necessary to answer the main question. Your task is to assess whether the given auxiliary question is relevant and necessary, Indirectly relevant, or completely irrelevant in answering the main question.

Result 1: [Completely Irrelevant]. In this case, you determine that even without the information from the auxiliary question, you can still answer the main question, or the information in the auxiliary question is completely unrelated to the answer of the main question.
Result 2: [Indirectly Relevant]. In this case, you find that the auxiliary question is related to the main question, but its answer is not part of the multiple pieces of information needed to answer the main question. The auxiliary question focuses on a related topic but does not provide critical information necessary for answering the main question.
Result 3: [Relevant and Necessary]. In this case, you find that the auxiliary question is a sub-question of the main question, meaning that without answering the auxiliary question, you will not be able to answer the main question. The information provided by the auxiliary question is necessary to answer the main question.

Example of Result 1:
Main Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Auxiliary Question: What is the purpose of the State of the Union address presented by the President of the United States?
In this case, after careful consideration, you find that the auxiliary question does not help answer the main question. The auxiliary question is completely unrelated to the main question. Your response should be:
```json{{"Decision":"Completely Irrelevant"}}```

Example of Result 2:
Main Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Auxiliary Question: What is the significance of this league for second teams in the region?
In this case, you notice that both the main and auxiliary questions involve similar topics, but the auxiliary question focuses on the significance of the league, while the main question asks about the league to which a specific player belongs. Upon careful consideration, you find that the auxiliary question is related, but its answer does not provide any critical information to answer the main question. Your response should be: 
```json{{"Decision":"Indirectly Relevant"}}```

Example of Result 3:
Main Question: Donnie Smith who plays as a left back for New England Revolution belongs to what league featuring 22 teams?
Auxiliary Question: Which team does Donald W. 'Donnie' Smith play for in Major League Soccer?
In this case, after careful consideration, you find that the auxiliary question is indeed related to the main question. The auxiliary question is a sub-question of the main question and provides necessary information to answer the main question. Without the answer to the auxiliary question, you will not be able to answer the main question. Your response should be: 
```json{{"Decision":"Relevant and Necessary"}}```

Now please strictly follow the JSON format in your response, avoiding unnecessary escapes, line breaks, or spaces. Additionally, please note that, except for the JSON and list formats, you should replace all double quotes with single quotes. For example, use '(How to Live) As Ghosts'
Main Question, Auxiliary Question as follows:
Main Question: {query}
Auxiliary Question: {question}

You are a query reformulation robot. I will provide you with a multi-hop query that touches multiple information. Your task is to break down the query into multiple sub-queries, each of which should be a single-hop query. The sub-queries should be related to each other and can be answered in sequence. You need to ensure that the sub-queries are clear and concise, and that they can be answered independently. Return as few subqueries as possible, but make sure that all the information in the original query is covered.
Your response must strictly follow the JSON format, avoiding unnecessary escapes, line breaks, or spaces. You should also pay extra attention to ensure that, except for the JSON and list formats themselves using double quotes ("), other instances of double quotes should be replaced with single quotes. For example, use '(How to Live) As Ghosts' instead of "(How to Live) As Ghosts".

### Example of Answer
```json{{"Subqueries":["What...?","How...?",.....]}}```

The followings are your multi-hop query:
{query}
